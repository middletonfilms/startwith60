# SO YOU'VE BEEN REJECTED FOR LIFE INSURANCE

## Don’t worry. You’ve still got options. (Really good ones.)

I’ll cut to the chase. This is the insurance company’s loss, not yours.  
You were about to give them— what, $100 every month? Over 40 years, that'd be $48,000.

They were going to invest that, turn it into over $600K, then hand you back $30-60K and pocket the rest.

I have a better pitch for you. Keep that full $600,000 for yourself.

As a former Life Insurance Agent, I’ve worked with hundreds of families— largely low to no income. I’ve worked with so many 60+ year olds who didn’t have $100 in their checking account. I’ve worked with too many 80 year olds who were desperate for just $5,000 of coverage because they had no money in savings, and the company forced me to decline them. 

I wish I had a time machine so I could go back just 40 years, shake these people, and tell them the same thing I’m about to tell you:

### There are funds you can put your money in— called index funds— that grow 10.4% every year on average. This is where the insurance company puts your money and everyone else’s, and it’s why they’re worth billions of dollars. 

Now, 10.4% per year might sound boring to you. With regular stocks, the value can double in a year. Or the value can 10x in one day. But— to be candid— that’s not going to be your luck. Stocks are gambling. You wouldn’t bet your mortgage at the casino, and for good reason.

Indexes are boring, and boring is good. Boring is safe. And for the record, boring is extremely lucrative.  

People who put $100 a month into an index fund average:
* $80K after 20 years
* $235K after 30 years
* $654K after 40 years

And If you can set aside $200/month or more… now we’re looking at millions. For your retirement, for your family’s inheritance… whatever you want. 

LET'S COMPARE:
| Whole Life Insurance | Index Fund |
|------|---|
|$100/month becomes |	$654,000 (over 40 years) | $654,000 (over 40 years) |
| You get back |$60,000 (generously) | $654,000 |
| They keep	$594,000 |$0|

Same money. Different outcome.


### “WHAT EXACTLY IS AN INDEX?”

When you put $100 into an index fund, you instantly own tiny pieces of hundreds of companies. This is the most famous index: the S&P500. It consists of the top 500 companies in America, proportional to their size.

Notice something? Apple's 7%. Microsoft's 6%. Google's 4%.

Apple grows? You make money. Microsoft grows? You make money. One company fails? Doesn't matter—499 others are still working for you.
That's why it's safe. That's why it works.

And your stake in each slice grows and shrinks as the companies do. It’s self correcting.

The S&P500 goes up and down, but since it was created in 1913, it has averaged a 10.4% growth every year. 

### “WHY HAVE I NEVER HEARD OF THIS BEFORE?”

You have. Every time someone mentions their "401(k)" or "retirement account"—that's an index fund. 
The difference? Most people get access through their employer. You have to set it up yourself.
It's not hidden. It's just not marketed to you.
Why? Because nobody makes commission when you invest directly.
Insurance agents work on comission. Financial advisors charge 1% per year to manage your money.
An index fund? Zero commission. Zero management fees. Nobody profits off you—except you.
That's why you've never had someone pitch this to you in a living room.


### GETTING IT DONE
 
Setting up an index fund will be much shorter, easier, and more profitable than your phone call with the life insurance agent. You don’t need a list of prescriptions or a medical exam, or to sift through tons of paperwork. 

Get started now. Set a timer for 10 minutes and **FOLLOW THIS STEP-BY-STEP GUIDE.** 
I couldn't help my 80-year-old clients. They ran out of time.
You haven't. 

I literally do not care which brokerage you choose. Just choose one and start today. Here's why: if you're 35 and start today, you'll have $654K at 75. Start at 36 instead? You'll have $591K. That one year cost you $63,000. To see exactly how much waiting costs YOU, **use this calculator**. 

That rejection wasn’t bad news. It was the best thing that could've happened to you. You were going to pay them for the privilege of investing your money. Now you get to cut out the middle man.
