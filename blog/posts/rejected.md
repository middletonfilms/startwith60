# SO YOU'VE BEEN REJECTED FOR LIFE INSURANCE
**[color(yellow):Don’t worry. You’ve still got really good options.]**

I’ll cut to the chase. This is the insurance company’s loss, not yours.  
You were about to give them— what, $100 every month? Over 40 years, that'd be $48,000.

They were going to invest that, turn it into over $600K, then hand you back $30-60K and pocket the rest.

I have a better pitch for you. **Keep that full $600,000 for yourself.**

As a former Life Insurance Agent, I’ve worked with hundreds of families— largely low to no income. I’ve worked with so many 60+ year olds who didn’t have $100 in their checking account. I’ve worked with too many 80 year olds who were desperate for just $5,000 of coverage because they had no money in savings, and the company forced me to decline them. 

I wish I had a time machine so I could go back just 40 years, shake these people, and tell them the same thing I’m about to tell you:

[box(thesis):There are funds you can put your money in— called index funds— that grow 10.4% every year on average. [color(green):This is where the insurance company puts your money and everyone else’s, and it’s why they’re worth billions of dollars.]]

If you set aside $100/month into an index every month, you'll have:
* $20,000 after 20 years
* $235,000 after 30 years
* **$654,000 after 40 years**

And If you can set aside $200/month or more… now we’re looking at millions. For your retirement, for your family’s inheritance… whatever you want. 
 
Setting up an index fund will be much shorter, easier, and more profitable than your phone call with the life insurance agent. You don’t need a list of prescriptions or a medical exam, or to sift through tons of paperwork.

I couldn't help my 80-year-old clients. They ran out of time.
You haven't.
